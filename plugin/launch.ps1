# GitHub release first; a download that does not match the pin is deleted
# and never run. `just plugin-dev` puts a local build in bin\ with a .dev
# marker, which is used as it is.

# Several Claude sessions may start the plugin at once, so each launch
# downloads to a file of its own and only a verified copy is moved into
# place; a launch that finds the pinned exe already there (or in use by
# another session) runs that one.

# Starting the pinned exe uses .NET only, no cmdlets: in the environment
# Claude Code starts plugins in, loading the modules of Join-Path,
# Get-Content and ConvertFrom-Json took seconds, and Claude Code takes a
# server that answers late for one that speaks an older protocol.
